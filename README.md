# Claude Experiments

Automated daily programming experiments generated by Claude Code.

## What is this?

This project runs Claude Code daily to create new programming experiments. Each day, it generates a new project idea, implements it, and saves the results in an organized structure.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   uv sync
   ```

2. Ensure Claude Code CLI is installed and configured

## How to run

Run a single experiment:
```bash
uv run python runner.py
```

The runner will:
- Generate a random project idea
- Use Claude Code to implement it
- Verify the implementation works
- Save results to `experiments/day_X_project_name/`

## Docker (24h loop)

Build and run with Docker for automated daily experiments:
```bash
docker build -t claude-experiments .
docker run -d claude-experiments
```

## Configuration

- Timeout: 20 minutes per Claude Code execution (adjustable in `runner.py`)
- Retry: Automatically retries once if verification fails
- Permission mode: Uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for automated file creation
