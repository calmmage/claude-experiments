STDOUT:
I've created a complete CLI tool for file organization. The project includes:

1. **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation with features, usage examples, and configuration guide
2. **run.sh** - Executable script to launch the tool
3. **organize.py** - Main Python script with the file organization logic
4. **custom_rules_example.json** - Example configuration for custom organization rules

The tool supports:
- Organizing by file type (documents, images, videos, etc.)
- Organizing by date
- Custom rules based on patterns and extensions
- Dry run mode to preview changes
- Undo functionality
- Recursive directory processing
- Duplicate file handling

You can run it with: `bash run.sh` or `./run.sh`
