STDOUT:
Perfect! The MVP automated backup tool is complete and working. Here's what I've created:

## âœ… MVP Automated Backup Tool

**Core Features:**
- **Automated directory backup** with timestamped folders
- **CLI interface** with intuitive commands 
- **JSON configuration** system with defaults
- **File exclusion patterns** (temp files, logs, git repos)
- **Backup management** (list, add/remove sources)
- **Error handling** for common issues

**Files Created:**
- `backup.py` - Core backup functionality (317 lines)
- `run.sh` - Executable runner script with help
- `README.md` - Complete documentation
- `backup_config.json` - Auto-generated on first run

**Usage:**
```bash
./run.sh backup          # Create backups
./run.sh list            # List existing backups  
./run.sh add-source ~/Projects  # Add backup source
./run.sh config          # Show configuration
```

The tool is self-contained, requires only Python 3, and can be started with `bash run.sh`. It creates timestamped backups in `~/Backups/` by default and includes comprehensive documentation.
