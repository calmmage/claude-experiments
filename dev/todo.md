## Better project implementation scenario

- [ ] Simplest tech test
- [ ] MVP of a meaningful cool essential feature
- [ ] A complete functional main scenario with thought-through User Scenario steps and UI

## Idea and work session tracking

- [ ] Implement basic idea and work session tracking (MongoDB or disk storage)
- [ ] Ideas collection - add ideas when they are selected for implementation
- [ ] Work session collection - track when and where we worked on each idea
  - [ ] Support multiple work sessions per idea (follow-up features, retries)
  - [ ] Track if same place (follow-up) or new place (retry)
  - [ ] Record session metadata: timestamp, location, implementation level, success/failure
